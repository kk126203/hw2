In part2, I follow the OSC tutorial, and set a for loop to dynamically allocate memory for the birthdat struct, then 
print it line by line by traversing the linkedlist.

In part3, I took away the linux/list.h and find the source code of all its function then pasted it to the LinkedList code, I
don't think it is poosible to finish that without understanding the content of those source code.

In part4, I follow the OSC and constrcut a task_strcut to show the current running tasks of the system. To output the DFS tree
in a heirachy format, I appended some spaces before the output strings according to the depth of each node. It can be
accomplished by giving the dfs function a "depth" parameter.
